Registration Form Project
This project is a dynamic registration form that validates user input and interacts with external mock APIs to populate dropdown fields. The form includes fields such as area codes, phone numbers, email, name, and company selection. Upon successful submission, the user is redirected to a confirmation page.

Features
Dynamic Dropdowns: Fetches area codes, companies, and subjects from Mocky.
Phone Number Validation: Ensures the phone number follows the Turkish format (e.g., 5xx xxx xx xx).
Customizable Design: Fully responsive form design using HTML and CSS.
Ad Closure: Includes functionality to close left and right ad banners dynamically.
Mock Submission: Redirects to a confirmation page (form-submitted.html) upon form submission.
